    "text": "Hi! My name is Cyrus Navasca, and I am a third-year student studying Statistics, Data Science and Math at UC Santa Barbara. Through my comprehensive academic involvement, as well as my experiences as a Data Analytics Intern for Daily Nexus and as President of the UCSB Data Science Collaborative, I have built a strong foundation of both technical and interpersonal skills that I am excited to expand upon!\nI have become proficient in Python, R, SQL and Tableau through various projects which made me fall in love with the process of data analysis, visualization and machine learning. Outside of work, I like watching football (go Niners!), playing card games, and trying new coffee shops.\nUsing data to tackle real-world problems is something that I am extremely looking forward to as I continue my journey in this field. My relentless work ethic and energetic personality are qualities that will allow me to succeed, no matter the setting, and I am ecstatic to apply myself in a team environment!\nI can be reached at cyrusnavasca@ucsb.edu, feel free to reach out and I am excited to hear from you all!"

As a Data Analytics Intern, I am responsible for collecting, cleaning and reporting data. Specifically, my goal is to tell stories from messy data which are relevant to my surrounding community.\nRecently, I have completed my first piece at the Daily Nexus, which was an analysis on the relationship between RateMyProfessor ratings and student GPAs at UC Santa Barbara. You can interact with the interactive dashboard below, or at this link.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident @ UCSB Data Science Collaborative\nThe UCSB Data Science Collaborative aims to make the field of data science accessible to new students and non-majors. During my time as President, I have mentored over 150 members and organized engaging networking events. I have also taught workshops in topics such as data visualization cleaning and machine learning, equipped with engaging presentation slides, and practice worksheets using sample datasets.\nBeing able to support new and ambitious students has been an extremely fulfilling experience. Additionally, I have learned so much from by breaking complex concepts into digestible pieces for members. This experience is one that has both reinforced my technical expertise and enhanced my interpersonal skills. Our website can be found at this link where you can find club photos, workshop presentations and worksheets!\n\n\n\nSpeaker event and Q&A session with Dr. Rituparna Sen and Prof. Katie Coburn\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Costco foods as an analogy for Python packages"
