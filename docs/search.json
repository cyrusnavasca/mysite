    "text": "Hi! My name is Cyrus Navasca, and I am a third-year student studying Statistics, Data Science and Math at UC Santa Barbara. Through my comprehensive academic involvement, as well as my experiences as a Data Analytics Intern for Daily Nexus and as President of the UCSB Data Science Collaborative, I have built a strong foundation of both technical and interpersonal skills that I am excited to expand upon!\nI have become proficient in Python, R, SQL and Tableau through various projects which made me fall in love with the process of data analysis, visualization and machine learning. Outside of work, I like watching football (go Niners!), playing card games, and trying new coffee shops.\nUsing data to tackle real-world problems is something that I am extremely looking forward to as I continue my journey in this field. My relentless work ethic and energetic personality are qualities that will allow me to succeed, no matter the setting, and I am ecstatic to apply myself in a team environment!\nI can be reached at cyrusnavasca@ucsb.edu, feel free to reach out and I am excited to hear from you all!"
