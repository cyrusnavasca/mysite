# About Me
Hi! My name is Cyrus Navasca, and I am a third-year student studying Statistics,
Data Science and Math at UC Santa Barbara. Through my comprehensive academic involvement, 
as well as  my experiences as a Data Analytics Intern for Daily Nexus and as President 
of  the UCSB Data Science Collaborative, I have built a strong foundation of 
both technical and interpersonal skills that I am excited to expand upon! 

I have become proficient in Python, R, SQL and Tableau through various projects 
which made me fall in love with the process of data analysis, visualization and
machine learning. Outside of work, I like watching football (go Niners!), playing 
card games, and trying new coffee shops.

Using data to tackle real-world problems is something that I am extremely
looking forward to as I continue my journey in this field. My relentless work 
ethic and energetic personality are qualities that will allow me to succeed, no
matter the setting, and I am ecstatic to apply myself in a team environment!

I can be reached at [cyrusnavasca@ucsb.edu](mailto:cyrusnavasca@ucsb.edu), feel 
free to reach out and I am excited to hear from you all!

# Experiences
### Data Analytics Intern @ Daily Nexus 
The Daily Nexus is the official university newspaper for UC Santa Barbara. As a
Data Analytics Intern, I am responsible for collecting, cleaning and reporting
data. Specifically, my goal is to tell stories from messy data which are relevant
to my surrounding community.

Recently, I have completed my first piece at the Daily Nexus, which was an 
analysis on the relationship between RateMyProfessor ratings and student GPAs
at UC Santa Barbara. You can interact with the interactive dashboard below, or
at this 
[link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cyrus.navasca/viz/UCSBstudentsreceivebettergradesincourseswithhigherRateMyProfessorratings/Dashboard1).

### President @ UCSB Data Science Collaborative
The UCSB Data Science Collaborative aims to make the field of data science 
accessible to new students and non-majors. During my time as President, I 
have mentored over 150 members and organized engaging networking events. I have
also taught workshops in topics such as data visualization cleaning and 
machine learning, equipped with engaging presentation slides, and practice 
worksheets using sample datasets.

Being able to support new and ambitious students has been an extremely fulfilling
experience. Additionally, I have learned so much from by  breaking complex
concepts into digestible pieces for members. This experience is one that has
both reinforced my technical expertise and enhanced my interpersonal skills. 
Our website can be found at this [link](https://dscollab.github.io/) where you
can find club photos, workshop presentations and worksheets!

# Projects
### Predicting Credit Card Default with Neural Networks
In this project, I utilized PyTorch to construct a neural network which predicts
credit card default among clients. I wrangled and transformed data to prepare
for analysis then enhanced model performance by 140% using various
statistical techniques.

Below are images of the final model's evaluation metrics. Specifics of my work 
can be found in my resume linked at the top of this site, and the code can be 
found at this [link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/cc-default-prediction/blob/main/Predicting_CC_Default_NN.ipynb).

### 2022 Diamond Price Analysis
For the following project, I implemented an in-depth regression analysis in
order to examine what factors had an effect on diamond prices in 2022. I 
conducted feature selection, polynomial transformation and identification of
unusual observations to obtain the final model. We ultimately found that carat,
clarity and color had statistically significant effects on 2022 diamond prices.

The project report can be found below, or at this [link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/diamond-price-analysis/blob/main/Diamonds_LR_Analysis.pdf).

## Interactive Dashboard of San Francisco Police Reports
This project utilized data from the city/county of San Francisco to create an
interactive dashboard visualizing police reports from January 2018 to 
August 2024. Over 800,000 observations of data were cleaned in Python in order
to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the data.

You can interact with the dashboard below, or at the following
[link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cyrus.navasca/viz/InteractiveDashboardofSanFranciscoPoliceReports/InteractiveDashboardofSFPoliceReports).

## Simulation Study of ANOVA
In this study, I analyzed the performance of the ANOVA test (F-test) under
various conditions. Millions of simulations were run to identify situations
where the ANOVA test performed well, and other situations where a permutation
test may be better used.

The full project report can be found below, and the GitHub repository
containing both the report and simulations can be accessed at this
[link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/simulation-study-anova).

## Predictive Modeling of Heart Disease
In my introductory machine learning project, I implemented Random Forest and
Logistic Regression models to predict heart disease among patients. This was my
first dive into machine learning and sparked my interest in the field. I learned
how to choose a model, conduct EDA, and evaluate models. 

Found below are some the visual evaluation metrics of both models, and the code 
can be found at this [link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/heart-disease-ml/blob/main/Heart_Disease_ML_Project.ipynb).
