### Data Analytics Intern @ Daily Nexus 
The Daily Nexus is the official university newspaper for UC Santa Barbara. As a
Data Analytics Intern, I am responsible for collecting, cleaning and reporting
data. Specifically, my goal is to tell stories from messy data which are relevant
to my surrounding community.

Recently, I have completed my first piece at the Daily Nexus, which was an 
analysis on the relationship between RateMyProfessor ratings and student GPAs
at UC Santa Barbara. You can interact with the interactive dashboard below, or

### President @ UCSB Data Science Collaborative
The UCSB Data Science Collaborative aims to make the field of data science 
accessible to new students and non-majors. During my time as President, I 
have mentored over 150 members and organized engaging networking events. I have
also taught workshops in topics such as data visualization cleaning and 
machine learning, equipped with engaging presentation slides, and practice 
worksheets using sample datasets.

Being able to support new and ambitious students has been an extremely fulfilling
experience. Additionally, I have learned so much from by  breaking complex
concepts into digestible pieces for members. This experience is one that has
both reinforced my technical expertise and enhanced my interpersonal skills.
