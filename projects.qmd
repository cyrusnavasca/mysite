### Predicting Credit Card Default with Neural Networks
In this project, I utilized PyTorch to construct a neural network which predicts
credit card default among clients. I wrangled and transformed data to prepare 
for analysis then enhanced model performance by 140% using various
statistical techniques.

Below are images of the final model's evaluation metrics. Specifics of my work 
can be found in my resume linked at the top of this site, and the code can be 
found at this [link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/cc-default-prediction/blob/main/Predicting_CC_Default_NN.ipynb).

### 2022 Diamond Price Analysis
For the following project, I implemented an in-depth regression analysis in
order to examine what factors had an effect on diamond prices in 2022. I 
conducted feature selection, polynomial transformation and identification of
unusual observations to obtain the final model. We ultimately found that carat,
clarity and color had statistically significant effects on 2022 diamond prices.

The project report can be found below, or at this [link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/diamond-price-analysis/blob/main/Diamonds_LR_Analysis.pdf).

## Interactive Dashboard of San Francisco Police Reports
This project utilized data from the city/county of San Francisco to create an
interactive dashboard visualizing police reports from January 2018 to 
August 2024. Over 800,000 observations of data were cleaned in Python in order
to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the data.

You can interact with the dashboard below, or at the following

## Simulation Study of ANOVA
In this study, I analyzed the performance of the ANOVA test (F-test) under
various conditions. Millions of simulations were run to identify situations
where the ANOVA test performed well, and other situations where a permutation
test may be better used.

The full project report can be found below, and the GitHub repository
containing both the report and simulations can be accessed at this
[link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/simulation-study-anova).

## Predictive Modeling of Heart Disease
In my introductory machine learning project, I implemented Random Forest and
Logistic Regression models to predict heart disease among patients. This was my
first dive into machine learning and sparked my interest in the field. I learned
how to choose a model, conduct EDA, and evaluate models. 

Found below are some the visual evaluation metrics of both models, and the code 
can be found at this [link](https://github.com/cyrusnavasca/heart-disease-ml/blob/main/Heart_Disease_ML_Project.ipynb).
